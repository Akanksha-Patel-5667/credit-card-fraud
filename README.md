# credit-card-fraud

This dataset is used for fraud detection and has a highly imbalanced class distribution, with the majority of transactions being non-fraudulent (Class 0) and a small percentage being fraudulent (Class 1).

Here's a breakdown of the dataset features:

Time: Represents the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.

Amount: Represents the transaction amount.

V1, V2, ..., V28: Numerical input variables that are the result of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation. These are likely features derived from the original dataset to reduce dimensionality.

Class: The response variable, taking a value of 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
